## History of Database Systems
Knowledge comes from Information. The information that survives a system directs the knowledge we gain from it. That's why archaeology requires artifacts and technology requires databases.

And the story of databases is a fascinating one. It has taken brilliant minds to move humanity from thinking navigationally to relationally to parallelly. These innovations have been captured in products like IBM Mainframes, RDBMS's like MySQL and PostGres, and big-data clusters like Apache Spark. This post is dedicated to tracking important dates and sources associated with the History of Database Systems.

### Key Dates
- 1964[^1]: Bachman's Integrated Data Store put in production; first system to use both data structures and virtual memory (paging)
